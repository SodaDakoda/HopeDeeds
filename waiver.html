        <div class="waiver-text">
          <h2>1. Release of Liability and Assumption of Risk</h2>
          <p>
            I, the undersigned volunteer, acknowledge that my participation in
            HopeDeeds' activities and events, including but not limited to food
            preparation, distribution, administrative work, and transportation,
            exposes me to potential risks of personal injury, illness (including
            infectious diseases like COVID-19), property damage, or death. I
            understand and voluntarily assume these risks. I hereby release,
            indemnify, and hold harmless HopeDeeds, its officers, directors,
            employees, and agents from any and all liability, claims, demands,
            or causes of action arising out of or related to any loss, damage,
            injury, or death that may be sustained by me while participating in
            these volunteer activities, regardless of whether the loss is caused
            by the negligence of HopeDeeds or otherwise.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Code of Conduct and Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            I agree to comply with all rules, policies, and instructions set
            forth by HopeDeeds, including those concerning safety, conduct, and
            interaction with beneficiaries, staff, and fellow volunteers. I
            agree to maintain the confidentiality of all sensitive information
            regarding the organization, its staff, and the individuals it
            serves. Any breach of this confidentiality or the Code of Conduct
            may result in the immediate termination of my volunteer status.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Authorization for Emergency Medical Treatment</h2>
          <p>
            In the event of an emergency, I authorize HopeDeeds staff or
            representatives to seek and consent to medical attention for me, if
            I am unable to do so myself. I understand that I am solely
            responsible for all costs associated with such medical care and
            transportation.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Media Release</h2>
          <p>
            I grant HopeDeeds the right to take photographs, videos, or other
            visual or audio recordings of me during my volunteer service and to
            use these images or recordings in promotional, educational, or
            fundraising materials without further compensation or notice.
          </p>
